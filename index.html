         <h2><i>Co-Owner, Addison&#39s and Sophia&#39s restaurants</i></span></h2> 
        
        <h4>Job description</h4>
        <p>A bit of everything, mostly supporting our great crew.</p>
        <h4>Hometown</h4>
        <p>Toronto, Canada.</p>
        <h4>Years lived in Columbia</h4>
        <p>30 or so.</p>
        <h4>Quote you live by</h4>
        <p><q>Keep moving forward</q> &#8722Maj. Richard Winters, from <i>Band of Brothers.</i></p>
        <h4>Favorite volunteer/community activity</h4>
        <p>Working with our economic development community through REDI in order to grow Columbia&#39s 
            economy. I am also passionate about our airport and making our air service as good as it can be. 
            As a member of the Columbia Airport Advisory Board, I&#39m excited to see us extend the main 
            runway so bigger planes can take off and land in all weather conditions, and I&#39m excited to 
            see the completion of the new terminal, set to open next summer.</p>
        <h4>Favorite recent project</h4>
        <p>The Swift Prepared Foods facility project that the team at REDI worked to win for Columbia over 
            several competing cities. We worked with many different stakeholders to bring Swift&#39s new operation 
            to town. It will be an Italian meat curing facility that will provide specialty meats to retailers 
            throughout the country. Swift will invest $200 million in the facility and create 250 new jobs in our 
            burgeoning food manufacturing corridor. </p>
        <h4>A Columbia businessperson you admire and why</h4>
        <p>Brian Whorley. His integrity and entrepreneurial spirit are beacons for anyone that wants to start their 
            own business. A few years ago, Brian had an idea to make health care more accessible and affordable 
            while helping employees with deductibles and unexpected expenses. His company Paytient is a rising startup 
            that is receiving national attention. Throughout, Brian has remained humble and continues to work hard 
            to realize his vision.  </p>
        <h4>Why you are passionate about your job</h4>
        <p>Every day is different. I enjoy the variety and challenges that come with operating our small businesses. 
            I also enjoy the interactions that I have with my staff and our customers. The restaurant business gets 
            in your blood, and those that love it love the friends and family we make along the way.  </p>
        <h4>Why you are passionate about your company</h4>
        <p>My partners, Jeremy Brown and Adam Dushoff, and I have created three restaurants that, so far, are popular 
            and see our share of repeat business. We want to continue to provide great food, great service, and an 
            interesting atmosphere to delight our guests.</p>
